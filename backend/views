from django.http import JsonResponse

# Define your view to return some data
def get_data(request):
    # Example response data
    data = {
        "message": "Hello from Django API!"
    }

    # Returning JsonResponse with a 200 OK status by default
    return JsonResponse(data, status=200)  # You can specify status code explicitly if needed
#This should work well for your simple API, but as your project grows, you might want to consider organizing views in class-based views (CBVs) or using Django Rest Framework for more structured APIs.
