# ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Build the React App
FROM node:16-alpine AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files first (improves caching)
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --production

# Copy the rest of the app
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Serve the app with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine

# Set a non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -S nginx && adduser -S nginx -G nginx

# Copy built React app to Nginx public directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx config (optional but recommended)
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy frontend site config
COPY nginx/conf.d/default.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Change file ownership to non-root user
RUN chown -R nginx:nginx /usr/share/nginx/html

# Switch to non-root user
USER nginx

# Expose the required port
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
