✅ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Milvus & FAISS
✅ Voice-Activated AI (Home Assistant + Whisper + Piper TTS)
✅ Automated AI Model Training via Airflow & N8N
✅ AI-Powered MTG & Business Intelligence Workflows

🔥 Features
✔ GPU-Accelerated LLM Server using Ollama + RTX 3090
✔ Secure API Gateway (Nginx + HTTPS + OAuth) 🔐
✔ Task Orchestration with N8N + Celery + Redis 🔁
✔ Vector Database Integration (Milvus + FAISS) 📚
✔ Custom Fine-Tuning Pipeline (Train LLMs on Your RAG Data) 🎓
✔ Real-Time AI Voice Assistant (Whisper STT + Piper TTS) 🎙️
✔ Automated Data Extraction & Training via Airflow 🔄
✔ Local and Remote AI Access via Home Assistant & N8N 🌍

🔧 Setup & Installation
1️⃣ Prerequisites
✅ 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose installed (Get Docker)
✅ 🎮 Nvidia GPU (RTX 3090 Recommended) for AI Acceleration
✅ 🔐 Optional: Domain name + SSL certificate for remote access

🎙️ Voice AI Setup (Home Assistant + Whisper + Piper TTS)
✅ Home Assistant listens for "Hey Assistant"
✅ Whisper converts voice to text
✅ N8N processes AI requests & triggers workflows
✅ Piper TTS speaks responses

🔹 To enable voice AI, configure configuration.yaml in Home Assistant.

📚 AI Model Training & Fine-Tuning
✅ Automated AI Training via Apache Airflow
✅ Fine-Tunes Mistral 7B / Llama 3 8B on RAG Data
✅ Retrains AI models overnight to improve accuracy

🎯 Future Improvements
🔹 Expand Multi-LLM Backend (Ollama, GPT, Claude, etc.)
🔹 Optimize AI Memory & Compute Scheduling
🔹 Enhance Security with SELinux/AppArmor Hardening
🔹 Custom Web Dashboard for AI & Model Performance
